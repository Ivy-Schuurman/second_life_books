            <p>The English Book Exchange is a little second-hand bookstore located close to the centrum of Amsterdam. The store itself is small, but don't let its size fool you. Filled with bookcases that reach all the way up to the ceiling, this store has a great selection of all different sorts of books. Besides its wide variation of genres, the quality of the books is also very good. When I visited the store there were even some very very old books and the quality of these books was quite good. the prices of the books were very nice aswell, with the prices varying around €6,50 I could even buy two books for the same price one book would be in a normal bookstore.</p>
            <p>I do recommend going to The English Book Exchange in the mornings or later during the day, because the store isn't very big it can get very crammed during rush hours. So going when it is less bussy is deffenetly recommended.</p>

            <p>Kok Antiquariaat A is a second-hand bookstore located near the centrum of Amsterdam. The bookstore is quite large and has a large collection of books. When is visited the store I found out they also sell postcards and older maps and even some very old books. The prices of the books in the store are a little bit on the high side, varying between the €7 - €9, but compared to normal bookstores are still considered low. The quality of the books were very good, of course you could still see that the books are second-hand, but compared to other second-hand bookstores I've visited Kok Antiquariaat A has the best quality when it come to the books.</p>
            <p>I do recommend that if you cannot read Dutch to go to another bookstore, like The English Book Exchange, because Kok Antiquariaat A has a very small amout of English books and mostly only sells Dutch books. The variation of genres that they sell is quite large though, so if you are learning Dutch and would like to read more Dutch books I can recommend this store to you. They sell Dutch books with an easier vocabulary, perfect for if you're learning but don't want to spent to much on a book.</p>
