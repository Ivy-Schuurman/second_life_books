                <h3>Why second-hand?</h3>
                <p>Amsterdam is a city with many, many bookstores, and for all the book lovers out there it's like heaven. But there aren't just your normal everyday bookstores that you can visit in the city, Amsterdam also has a good amount of second-hand bookstores that you can find.</p>
                <p>Now you might find yourself asking, why would I buy second-hand books? Well, buying second-hand books is a very easy way to live a little bit more sustainable. In the current day and age our environment isn't doing very well, by buying books second-hand you help with bettering the environment. When we start buy second-hand books we reduce the amount of books that will be thrown away and give them a new life instead. Most of the books that you find in second-hand bookstores are still very usable, but most books that we don't need anymore usually don't end up in these bookstores. Thus I believe that when looking for a book we might first want to take our chances in a second-hand bookstore, and when we don't need a book anymore we should donate it or re-sell it instead of throwing it away.</p>

                <h3>Benefits of buying second-hand!!</h3>
                <p>Buying books second-hand has more benefits that just being good for the environment. For instance, every book lover knows that reading can be quite an expensive hobby, now what if I told you that buying books second-hand can fix this problem. Because the books you buy at second-hand bookstores aren't completely new the price is a lot lower then usual. Now instead of having to pay €13 - €15 you can buy a book for half of that price, yes the quality of the book isn't the same as a completely new book but its stil perfectly usable.</p>
